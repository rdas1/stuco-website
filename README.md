Website Updates:-	There needs to be an administrative portal in which non-coders can make edits and update the website.
-	They should be able to make edits to any portion of the website with special attention to the:
	 - Committee Pages
   - Student information tabs
   - About
   - Home
   - Updates
   - News
   - Events
   - Legislation

Any other updates that you feel are necessary to make the website cleaner are fine by me!
